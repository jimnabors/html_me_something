    <p>My name is Jim Nabors.19 years ago I started a business in Collierville, TN called Fabric By The Square.  We were located on the historic town square thus playing off the name Fabric By The Square.</p>

<h2>Collierville Upholstery</h2>      
  </p>Collierville Upholstery was spun out of Fabric By The Square, so the business could absorb a partner and be marketed independtly of Fabric By The Square. Through the years of owning Fabric By The Square I realized I wasn't reaching enough of the market through the store and people that purchased fabric elsewhere felt intimidated to inquire about the upholstery side of the business. Collierville Upholstery simply allowed me to position the business to the same audience under a different brand thus expanding our reach.
